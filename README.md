# direct-adaptive-fuzzy-control-for-manipulator
The project reproduces direct adaptive fuzzy control scheme for a class of continuous-time uncertain MIMO nonlinear dynamic systems in [1]. Since the fuzzy system is employed to approximate the unknown ideal controller, the gradient descent algorithm is utilized to update the adjustable parameters of the fuzzy system.
